Dynamic Target is a virtual representation of a tracked tag. Rotation and position is updated relative to the user's transform, and the
pose of the marker assigned as a target in the accompanying [TrackableIdentity](en/ScriptingReference/TrackableIdentity) 

- When Trackable Identity is set to Beacon, Dynamic Target will look like the one in the following image:

- When Trackable Identity is set to Controller, Dynamic Target will be observed like this:

!> When YawOnly is checked, Dynamic Target will only update the rotation around Y-axis. This feature is useful when Pitch (rotation around X-axis) or Roll (rotation around Z-axis) is not needed.

### Public Members

#### YawOnly
- `public bool YawOnly { get; set; };`

If this is set to Falseï¼Œrotation around x,y,z will be updated. If this is set to true, only rotation around Y-axis will be updated.
