## Hello RhinoX

In this tutorial, we are about to show you how to create an augmented reality application for RhinoX step by step.

- Create a new scene, and name it "Hello RhinoX". Then delete MainCamera Object.
- Add ARCamera from the menu(shown below) and place it at [0,0,1.7]. The position can be anywhere desired by developers. We use [0,0,1.7] as an example here.
- Place Cubes and Spheres in the scene to create visual refferences.

Please keep this hiercharchy. When moving the camera object, please make sure you are always moving the parent object, ARCameraRig. 


## Project Compilation

### Install APK and Launch Application through Launcher

Once APK is installed and launched, you can now wear RhinoX headset to experience the AR experience. If you are not familiar with APK installation process, you can check out [the official Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/android-BuildProcess.html) for more information.
